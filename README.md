# TUCN ETTI diploma thesis template

This is a fork of the [TGM-HIT typst diploma thesis](https://github.com/TGM-HIT/typst-diploma-thesis/). Not everything was ported over. Check their (awesome) documentation in case you get stuck.

## Getting Started

TODO: finish and upload to typst packages.

1. Clone this repo somewhere.
2. `mkdir -p $XDG_DATA_HOME/typst/packages/local/tucn-diploma-thesis`
3. `ln -s path/to/repo $XDG_DATA_HOME/typst/packages/local/tucn-diploma-thesis/0.1.0`

To work locally, use the following command:

```bash
typst init @local/tucn-diploma-thesis
```

## Usage

The template contains the thesis structure as defined by the ETTI faculty, as well as writing advice as example content.
